    "question": "Carson needs to mow the lawn and plant some flowers. Carson has to mow 40 lines to cover the whole yard, and it takes him 2 minutes to mow one line. He also needs to plant 8 rows of flowers, each with 7 flowers, and it takes him half a minute to plant each flower. How many minutes will Carson spend gardening?",
    "answer": "First find the total time Carson spends mowing: 40 lines * 2 minutes/line = <<40*2=80>>80 minutes\nThen find the total number of flowers Carson plants: 8 rows * 7 flowers/row = <<8*7=56>>56 flowers\nThen multiply that number by the time taken to plant each flower to find the total time spent planting flowers: .5 minutes/flower * 56 flowers = <<.5*56=28>>28 minutes\nFinally, add that time to the time spent mowing to find the total time spent gardening: 28 minutes + 80 minutes = <<28+80=108>>108 minutes\n#### 108",

    "question": "Betty is growing parsnips in her vegetable garden. When the parsnips are grown, they are harvested and bundled into boxes that can hold up to 20 parsnips each. Each harvest, three-quarters of the boxes are full, and the remaining boxes are half-full. She gets an average of 20 boxes each harvest. How many parsnips does Betty grow in an average harvest?",
    "answer": "If three-quarters of the boxes are full, then 1 \u2013 \u00be = \u00bc of the boxes are half-full.\nOn average, each harvest therefore has 20 boxes * 0.25 = <<20*0.25=5>>5 boxes that are half-full.\nThis leaves 20 total boxes \u2013 5 half-full boxes = <<20-5=15>>15 full boxes.\nHalf-full boxes hold 20 parsnips / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 parsnips each.\nIn total, the half-full boxes, therefore, hold 5 boxes * 10 parsnips = <<5*10=50>>50 parsnips.\nThe full boxes hold a total of 15 boxes * 20 parsnips = <<15*20=300>>300 parsnips.\nSo Betty harvests a total of 50 + 300 = <<50+300=350>>350 parsnips in an average harvest.\n#### 350",
